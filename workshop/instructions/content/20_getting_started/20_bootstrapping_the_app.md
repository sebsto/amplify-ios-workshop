The starting point for the workshop is the [Apple Swift UI tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/tutorials) at the "Handling User Input" step. I slightly modified the app to make it a SwiftUI-only application. Start with the ZIP file provided below.

1. Download the {{% button href="/20_getting_started/20_bootstrapping_the_app.files/HandlingUserInput.zip" icon="fas fa-download" %}}project zip file{{% /button %}}  
The file has the following directory structure

2. This workshop will start from the *Complete* version of the tutorial project.  In the remaining part of this workshop, `$PROJECT_DIRECTORY` will refer to `~/Downloads/amplify-ios-workshop/Complete/Landmarks`.  

    Unzip the file and open the Xcode project:

 ```bash
 # download the workshop ZIP file
 # TODO update download URL when final
 # curl -o ~/Downloads/HandlingUserInput.zip https://amplify-ios-workshop-new.go-aws.com/20_getting_started/20_bootstrapping_the_app.files/HandlingUserInput.zip

 # unzip 
 cd ~/Downloads
 unzip HandlingUserInput.zip
 cd amplify-ios-workshop

 # set env variable
 PROJECT_DIRECTORY=~/Downloads/amplify-ios-workshop/Complete/Landmarks
 cd $PROJECT_DIRECTORY

 # open xcode 
 open HandlingUserInput.xcodeproj
 ```

You can safely ackowledge Xcode's message informing you this app has been downloaded from Internet.

3. In Xcode, **Choose** the iOS Simulator you want to use (I am using iPhone 14) and click the **build** icon <i class="far fa-caret-square-right"></i> or press **&#8984;R**.

After a few seconds, you should see the application running in the iOS simulator.

In the following steps, we will guide you through step by step instructions to modify this app to add user authentication and a data-driven API.
