You just add a bit of logic in `AppDelegate` class to sign in and to sign out users.  You also modified the screen flow to start the app with a `LandingView` that controls the routing towards a `UserBadge` or the `LandmarkList` view based on the user authentication status.

Let's now verify everythign works as expected.  Start the application using Xcode's menu and click **Product**, then **Run** (or press **&#8984;R**).

The application starts and shows the `LandingView`.  Click on the user icon in the middle of the screen to trigger the user authentication, using Cognito's web user interface. Click on **Sign up** at the bottom of the screen to signup a new user.

After clicking **Sign Up**, check your email.  Cognito sends you a confirmation code.

Click **Sign Out** to end the session and, after a short redirection to Cognito's signout page, you return to the `LandingView`.

In the Xcode console, you see some application debugging information: the username and profile of the signed in user as well as its Cognito token.
