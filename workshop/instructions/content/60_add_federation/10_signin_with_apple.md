Nowadays, most applications allow users to sign-in using a third-party identity, defined and managed outside of your app.  This is known as Identity Federation.  Amazon Cognito does support Identity Federation out of the box with [Login With Amazon](https://login.amazon.com/), [Login with Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in), [Login with Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/), [Sign in with Apple](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-set-up-sign-in-with-apple-for-amazon-cognito/), or any [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) or [SAMLv2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0) compliant identity provider.

Just as for regular sign in flow, you can chose to present to your customers the Cognito Hosted UI or to build your own.  In this workshop, we chose to use the hosted UI because it handles most of the complexities of the OAuth flow for you.

In this section, we're going to add a "Sign in with Apple" button to our application.  Because we are using the Cognito hosted web user interface, there is no code change required to add "Sign in with Apple" or "Login with xxx". This is a two steps process:

- we use our developer account on Apple Developer's portal and we configure "Sign in with Apple" for this application. This involves registering our app and the Cognito URLs on Apple Developer portal, and generate and download a private key to be included in Cognito's configuration.

- we update the Amplify configuration to add Apple as an identity provider.

You must have an account on Apple Developer's portal to continue this section. You can sign in using your Apple ID, the same you are using to connect to iCloud, iMessage, and the likes. Or you can signup and create an account at [https://appleid.apple.com/account](https://appleid.apple.com/account)

## Configure Sign in with Apple on Apple Developer portal

This is a multi-steps process.  First, we are going to create an **App Identifier** for our app. Second, we are going to create a Sign in with Apple **Service Identifier** and configure it with the URLs of our Cognito server. Finally, we are going to **create a secret key** passed to Cognito.

These three steps are done on the Apple Developer's portal.

### Create an Application Identifier

- Using your favorite browser, navigate to Apple Developer's portal at [https://developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com). Select the **Account** link on the top right side. Authenticate using your Apple ID credentials.

- On the main page, select **Identifiers** (the second option on the second column).

- On the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profile** page, select the âŠ• sign next to **Identifiers** to add an identifier for this app.

![Signin with Apple 02](/images/60-10-signin-apple-02.png)

- On the **Register a new identifier** page, ensure **App IDs** is selected and select **Continue**.

- On the **Register a new identifier > Select a type** page, ensure **App** is selected (the default), and select **Continue**.

- Enter **Amplify iOS Workshop 2022** as **Description** and **com.yourcompany.amplify.workshop.landmarks** as **Bundle ID**. Bundle IDs must be globally unique, be sure to chose an available name. Typically, it uses your company reverse DNS name.

Take note of the **App ID Prefix (Team ID)** as we will pass this value to Amplify later on
{{% /notice %}}

- Scroll down that page and select **Sign in with Apple**.  Select **Continue** on the top of the page, then select **Register** on next page. The new identifier should appear in the list of identifiers.

## Create a Service Identifier 

Now that our app is registered, let's create a Service Identifier for Sign in with Apple.

- On the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profile** page, select **App IDs** drop down menu on the top right side, then select **Services IDs**.

![Signin with Apple 05](/images/60-10-signin-apple-05.png)

- Select **Register an Services ID** blue button in the middle of the page.

- On the **Register a new identifier** page, select **Services ID** (the second option), the select **Continue**.

- Type **Amplify iOS Workshop 2022** as **Description** and **com.yourcompany.amplify.workshop.landmarks.signin** as **Identifier**. Note that the Service ID here *must be* different than the Application ID created earlier.  I added `.signin` at the end. I then select **Continue**.

![Signin with Apple 06](/images/60-10-signin-apple-06.png)

- On the next page, select **Register**.

- On the **Identifiers > Services ID** page, select the newly created service identifier for this workshop. Ensure **Sign In with Apple** is selected. Then select the **Configure** button.

![Signin with Apple 07](/images/60-10-signin-apple-07.png)

- On the **Web Authentication Configuration** page, select the **Amplify iOS Workshop 2022** for the **Primary App ID**. Then enter the **Domains and Subdomains** value and the **Return URLs**.

Amplify and Cognito shared these values when you added user authentication to the Cognito configuration. You can retrieve them back by typing the `amplify status` command in the project directory.  The value return contains a line like :

```bash
Hosted UI Endpoint: https://landmarks214c303c-214c303c-dev.auth.eu-central-1.amazoncognito.com/
```

The **Domains and Subdomains** value is the full host name **without** the `https://`.

The **Return URLs** value is the full URL (**including** `https://`) with `/oauth2/idpresponse` added to it.

Pay attention to these two values, an error will prevent Sign in with Apple to work.  Proceed to the next step when you have double checked your input values.
{{% /notice %}}

- Finally, select **Continue** and **Save** on the next two pages to finalize the Service ID configuration.

## Create a private key 

The last step consists in creating a private key to validate the communication between Sign in with Apple and Cognito.

-  On the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profile** page, select the **Keys** section on the left navigation menu.

![Signin with Apple 09](/images/60-10-signin-apple-09.png)

- Select **Create a key** blue button in the middle of the page.

- On the **Register a New Key** page, enter a name for that key. I entered **Amplify iOS Workshop Sign In Key** as **Key Name**. Make sure **Sign in with Apple** is selected and select **Configure**.

![Signin with Apple 10](/images/60-10-signin-apple-10.png)

- On the **Configure Key** page, select the **Amplify iOS Workshop 2022** as **Primary App ID**. Then select **Save**.

![Signin with Apple 11](/images/60-10-signin-apple-11.png)

- On next page, select **Continue**, then **Register** to finish creating the key.

- On the **Download Your Key** page, select **Download** to download a `.p8` file containing the private key just created.

![Signin with Apple 12](/images/60-10-signin-apple-12.png)

{{% notice warning %}}
Take a note of the **Key ID** value and the `.p8` private key, as we will pass them to amplify in the next step.
{{% /notice %}}

The `.p8` file you just downloaded contains a private key in PEM format. This is a multi-line base64 notation. In the next section, Amplify command line will ask for this value as a **single-line** input.

To convert the `.p8` file content to a single line, you may use this bash command and paste the rwsult in the text editor.

```bash
cat ~/Downloads/AuthKey_*.p8 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy 
```

### Collect all IDs required by Amplify

At the end of this section, you must have kept four values to pass to Amplify command line. The values I collected from the above example are : 

- the **Service ID** (the one finishing with `.signin`) : `com.yourcompany.amplify.workshop.landmarks.signin`
- the **Team ID** : `56******`
- the **Key ID** : `3HL6GKYJ5L`
- the **private key** in one single line PEM format : `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----MIG...(redacted)...gty6P-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`

The values will be different for you.

Next step is to update AWS Amplify's configuration to include Sign in with Apple.
