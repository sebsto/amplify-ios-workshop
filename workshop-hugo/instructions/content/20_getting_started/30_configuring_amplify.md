This workshop proposes to use [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), an open-source library to create and integrate with a cloud-based backend.  AWS Amplify comprises two components: a [command line tool](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/quickstart) to easily provision cloud-based services from your laptop and a [library](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/ios/start) to access these services from your application code. You installed the CLI as part of the [prerequisites instructions](/10_prerequisites/20_installs.html#installing-or-updating).  For this workshop we will use the new [Amplify Library for Swift](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/q/platform/ios/). This new version is entirely built in Swift and support modern Swift constructs, such as `async` / `await` patterns for concurrent code.

## Add Amplify to your application

Amplify for iOS is distribued with [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) (SPM) or [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/). In this workshop, we will use SPM to add the required Amplify packages to your project in Xcode.

In Xcode, select **File**, **Add Packages...**

![xcode add packages](/images/20-30-add-packages.png)

In the top right search bar, type `https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-swift`. For **Dependency Rules**, select **Up to Next Major Version** and type `2.0.0` as version. Then, select **Add Package** button on the bottom right.

Depending on the internet bandwidth and the model of your laptop, it might take a few minutes to download and verify Amplify and its dependencies.

Select the four linked libraries containing the Amplify code we will use for this project:
- `Amplify`: the core library
- `AWSAPIPlugin`: the library to access GraphQL APIs 
- `AWSCognitoAuthPlugin`: the library to include user authentification
- `AWSS3StoragePlugin`: the library to access images or files stored on S3.

Once these four libraries are select, select **Add Package**.

## Initialize Amplify

The first time you use AWS Amplify in a project, Amplify needs to initialise your project directory and the cloud environment.  We assume *$PROJECT_DIRECTORY* is set and unchanged from [previous step](/20_getting_started/20_bootstrapping_the_app.html).

In a Terminal, type the following commands:

```bash  
cd $PROJECT_DIRECTORY
amplify init
```

1. Enter a name for your project: enter **amplifyiosworkshop** and press enter.

2. Accept all the default values. Accept the default **Yes** and press enter.

3. Select the authentication method you want to use? accept the default **AWS Profile** and press enter.

4. Please choose the profile you want to use: accept the default **default** or type the name of the profile you created during [step 1.3](/10_prerequisites/10_bring_your_own_account.html#configuring-the-aws-command-line) (such as **workshop**) and press enter.

5.  Help improve Amplify CLI by sharing non sensitive configurations on failures. I choose to accept toshare information with the Amplify team.  Type **Y** to continue.

Amplify will create a local directory structure to host your project's meta-data.  In addition, it will create the backend resources to host your project : two IAM roles, an S3 bucket and a AWS Cloudformation template.  After 1 or 2 minutes, you should see the below messages:

![amplify init](/images/20-30-amplify-init-ok.png)

You might safely ignore the Xcode error message. We will manually add libraries to the source code of the project.

### Add Amplify configuration files to the project 

Rather than configuring each service through a constructor or constants file, the Amplify and the underlying AWS SDKs for iOS support configuration through centralized files called `awsconfiguration.json` and `amplifyconfiguration.json`. They defines all the regions and service endpoints to communicate. Whenever you run `amplify push`, these files are automatically created allowing you to focus on your Swift application code. On iOS projects the `awsconfiguration.json` and `amplifyconfiguration.json` are located at the root project directory. You have to add them manually to your Xcode project.

In the Finder, select `awsconfiguration.json` and `amplifyconfiguration.json` and drag the two files into Xcode under the top Project Navigator folder (the folder named *HandleUserInput*). When the *Options* dialog box appears, do the following:

- Clear the **Copy items if needed** check box.
- Choose **Create groups**
- Select **Add to target: Landmarks**, and then choose **Finish**.

Before proceeding to the next step, ensure you have both files added to your project, like one the screenshot below.

## Build the project

Now that weâ€™ve added Amplify tools to the build process, it will run when you build you project.  Before proceeding to the next steps, **build** (&#8984;B) the project to ensure there is no compilation error. 

You are ready to start building with Amplify! ðŸŽ‰
